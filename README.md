## Project Overview

**RAYS** is a social media application developed as part of the ITPE3200 course project. The primary focus of the application is to allow users to create, post, and share various types of media, including notes, images, and YouTube video links. This project aims to demonstrate a full-stack application built with .NET on the backend and React on the frontend, with a responsive design using TailwindCSS.

Although the initial version of RAYS is scoped to handle basic post functionality, future iterations may include features such as friend requests and direct messaging, which are currently outside the project scope.
